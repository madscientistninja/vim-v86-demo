# vim-v86-demo
This is a experimental demo of the VIM text editor running in the browser, using a JS x86 cpu emulator.
It is not completed yet but will be out soon, It will run on some kind of Javascript CPU emulater likly v86
from https://github.com/copy/v86 but I still might change my mind.
Instead of a frame buffer a serial terminal will be used as the terminal displaying vim.
So I can experiment with thinks like displaying html though vim for the browser to render.
I was thinking of using FreeDOS floppy image because it allready has a port of VIM and
it is super small but I had trubble sending though the serial connection so that may not work.
